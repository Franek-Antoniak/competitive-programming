Title: max-area-of-island
Proramming Language: Java
*/

//You are given an m x n binary matrix grid. An island is a group of 1's (
//representing land) connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume 
//all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water. 
//
// The area of an island is the number of cells with a value 1 in the island. 
//
// Return the maximum area of an island in grid. If there is no island, return 0
//. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,
//0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,
//0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
//]
//Output: 6
//Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-
//directionally.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
//Output: 0
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// m == grid.length 
// n == grid[i].length 
// 1 <= m, n <= 50 
// grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
